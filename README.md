//This started as a fork for freeCodeCamp's practice product landing page. After writing code that passed the tests,
//I wanted to spice it up. That meant changing things that won't now pass the official tests, but I used the opportunity
//to practice using css to make very complicated shapes, animate shapes and the like.
